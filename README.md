| TOKEN | Discord Bot Token |
| MOD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID | Moderation Log Channel ID |

# 🔒 Required Bot Permissions

Your bot must have:

- View Channels
- Read Message History
- Send Messages
- Manage Messages
- Moderate Members
- Embed Links

The bot's role must also be **higher than the members it needs to moderate**.

---

# ❓ Troubleshooting

## Bot is Offline

- Verify your bot token.
- Make sure Message Content Intent is enabled.
- Check Render deployment logs.
- Confirm all environment variables are set correctly.

---

## Bot Cannot Delete Messages

Ensure the bot has:

- Manage Messages
- View Channels
- Read Message History

---

## Bot Cannot Timeout Users

Ensure:

- Moderate Members permission is enabled.
- The bot's highest role is above the user's role.

---

## Environment Variables Not Working

Do **NOT** commit your `.env` file.

Instead, add each variable manually inside Render.

If you change any environment variable, redeploy the service.

---

# 💰 Render Free Plan

SpamGuardian runs on Render's Free plan.

To avoid unexpected charges:

- Keep your service on the **Free** instance type.
- Monitor usage in your Render dashboard.
- Do not upgrade to a paid instance unless you intend to.
- A temporary **$1 authorization hold** may appear when adding a payment method. This is usually a card verification and not a recurring charge.

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

- Edit message spam detection
- Slash commands
- Per-server configuration
- Database support
- Role & channel whitelist
- Dashboard
- Smarter attachment fingerprinting
